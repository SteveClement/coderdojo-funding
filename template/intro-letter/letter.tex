%===================================
\opening{Dear \#PERSONALIZATION\_HERE,}

CoderDojo Luxembourg is a CodeClub Luxembourg project driven by volunteers to teach coding and technologies to youngsters aged 9 to 18.

For the past year a steady group of 15-20 Kids has gathered in the heart of Luxembourg-City every Thursday no matter the weather.

In that time we grew a steady waiting-list to teach code to the young ones and we have decided to ramp-up our efforts and raise funding to provide further days where other Kids can enjoy the marvellous world of Technologies.

CodeClub Luxembourg being a volunteer driven non-profit we are always looking for new mentors who can enable the Kids to learn new skills.

Facing the reality that you can only do so much by volunteering, and having a strong demand for an after-school Dojo, we are looking to raise enough funds to create a half-time employment amidst our Dojo.

Attached you will find our proposal where you can actively take part in realising this feat and write a little bit of history in the small state of Luxembourg.

\closing{Sincerely yours,}
