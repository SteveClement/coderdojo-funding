Dear #PERSONALIZE_HERE,

My name is Steve Clement and I am the lead on the CoderDojo Luxembourg.

Every week a group of awesome mentors and myself teach Kids aged from 9 to 18 how to code and be amazed by technologies.

I took the liberty to write this mail directly to you as I feel you will be interested in talking about our efforts.

Attached you will find a small introduction letter and a rather straight proposal how you and your company can help.

Please feel free to either reply to this message or why not call me directly on +352 691 20 33 66 to arrange a meeting where I can give you all the necessary details about our efforts.

Thanks for your precious time.

Have an amazing day.

Steve Clement, CoderDojo Luxembourg Champion (#CHAMPION LINK)
